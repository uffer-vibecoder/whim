# 🛒 Cartwheel — Roadmap

An American "dopamine store": all the shopping, none of the spending. This file tracks
what's shipped and what's next. Guiding principle: **delight without harm** — we simulate
the *thrill* of buying, never nudge people toward real overspending.

---

## ✅ Shipped

- **Core loop** — storefront → product page → cart → fake checkout → live delivery tracker
- **Live delivery map** — animated truck warehouse → home, ETA countdown, step progress
- **Playful brand** — Baloo 2 / Nunito, gradient tiles, confetti + synthesized sounds
- **Persistence** — cart in localStorage, "money saved by not buying" tally
- **Deploy** — GitHub Pages, one-command `npm run deploy`

### Latest drop (v0.2)
- **Sponsored ad slot** — small, clearly-labeled, privacy-first-network-ready, non-predatory
- **Sound & motion polish** — persisted mute, richer audio, fly-to-cart, page transitions, number bumps
- **Thrifted category** — secondhand finds with a ♻️ badge + condition text
- **Delivery windows** — pick your own (30s–3h) or 🎲 random; tracker compresses long windows

## 🔜 Planned

### 1. Accounts & "Drops"  _(next big rock)_
- **User accounts** — sign up / sign in; sync cart, haul history, and the savings tally across devices
- **Drops** — limited "new arrival" product releases on a schedule (scarcity is the dopamine)
- **Notifications** — opt-in alerts when a new drop lands:
  - Web push (PWA) + email; per-user "notify me" on individual drops
  - A "Drops" tab with a countdown to the next release
- **Proposed stack:** Supabase (auth + Postgres + Row Level Security) — mirrors the approach
  used on the budgeting app; web push via the Push API + a service worker.
- **Guardrail:** notifications celebrate *browsing*, never shame or "you left items in your cart"
  dark patterns. Easy one-tap unsubscribe.

### 2. Real / AI product imagery  _(in progress)_
- Replace emoji tiles with real photos (Unsplash) or tasteful AI images
- Add an `image` field per product with blur-up loading + emoji fallback
- Note: `source.unsplash.com` (keyword) was retired in 2024 — use the **Unsplash API**
  (free access key) for on-the-fly search, or curated/verified photo IDs

### 3. Monetization, ethically
- Swap the house ad for a real **contextual, privacy-first** network (EthicalAds / Carbon)
- **"Fake sales" data product** — aggregate, anonymized demand signals (what people *almost*
  buy) that real advertisers/brands may find valuable, without tracking individuals

## 💡 Backlog / ideas
- Wishlist / "saved" tab and shareable hauls
- Seasonal collections & themed drops
- Daily "free dopamine" streaks (browse, don't buy)
- Sound themes; reduced-motion-first toggle in UI
- Leaderboard of "most saved by not buying"
